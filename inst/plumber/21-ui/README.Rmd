# User Interface

The default user interface for Plumber APIs is [Swagger](https://swagger.io/). Since Plumber APIs are based on the OpenAPI Specification, other common interfaces can be used. Two additional interfaces that are currently supported are [ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) and [RapiDoc](https://mrin9.github.io/RapiDoc/). There are in-development GitHub packages that make using these interfaces with Plumber fairly straightforward:

* ReDoc: https://github.com/meztez/redoc
* RapiDoc: https://github.com/meztez/rapidoc

## Endpoints

-   `/echo`: Echo back the input
-   `/plot`: Return a histogram of 100 random normal values
-   `/sum`: Return the sum of 2 values
