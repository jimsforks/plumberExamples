This example highlights how a Plumber API can be used in connection with a
GitHub webhook to automatically update the Plumber package anytime an update a
pushed to the GitHub repository.

Note this requires a valid GitHub key stored as `github-key.txt` in order to
properly work.

## Endpoints

* `/version`: Return information about the currently installed version of Plumber
* `/update`: Checks to ensure the incoming request is an authenticated GitHub request, then updates the system installed version of Plumber.
