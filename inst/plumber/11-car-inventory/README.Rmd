# Car Inventory
A collection of endpoints that all relate to an inventory of cars. This example
illustrates typical CRUD API design with each endpoint related to a specific
action performed against the car inventory list.


## Endpoints

-   GET `/car`: List all cars
-   GET `/car/id`: Lookup a car by id
-   POST `/car`: Add a car to the inventory
-   PUT `/car`: Update a car in the inventory
-   DELETE `/car/id`: Delete a car from the inventory
