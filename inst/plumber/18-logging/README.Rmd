# Plumber Logging

This is a simplified version of the example in
[sol-eng/plumber-logging](https://github.com/sol-eng/plumber-logging).
This example highlights how Plumber APIs can be built with additional
logging in order to capture information about incoming requests.

## Endpoints

  - `/echo`: Echo back the input
  - `/plot`: Return a histogram of 100 random normal values

## Definition

```{r logging}
```
