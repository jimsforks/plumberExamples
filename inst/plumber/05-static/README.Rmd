# Static File Server

This example sets up two static file servers. One at the default path (`/public`), and another at an explicit path (`/static`). You should be able to access the two files in the `./files` directory at either of those paths. So try `http://localhost:8000/static/b.txt` or `http://localhost:8000/public/a.html`.

## Endpoints

- `/`: Information about the static file server
- `/static/a.html`: The contents of `./files/a.html`
- `/static/b.txt`: The contents of `./files/b.txt`
- `/public/a.html`: The contents of `./files/a.html`
- `/public/b.txt`: The contents of `./files/b.txt`
