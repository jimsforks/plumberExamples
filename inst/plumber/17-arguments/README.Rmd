# Arguments

This example highlights challenges that can occur when you depend solely on Plumber to automatically parse request arguments. Since arguments can be presented in a variety of different ways as part of a request, it is best practice to manually parse the arguments in the manner you expect to receive them.

## Endpoints

-   `/bad-practice/<a>/<b>`: List back the parsed arguments
-   `/good-practice/<a>/<b>`: List various arguments as represented by the `req` object`

## Definition

### [plumber.R](plumber.R)

```{r arguments}
```
