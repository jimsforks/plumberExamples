# Plumber filters

This examples show how Plumber filters work by implementing a rudimentary
authentication mechanism.

## Endpoints

* `/me`: Returns the identity of the user, as defined in the `username` query
string parameter. Users are "authenticated" against a set list.
* `/about`: This endpoint preempts the authentication endpoint and is therefore
available to all users, whether they are valid or not.

## Definition
### [plumber.R](plumber.R)
```{r filter}
```

### [Tidy plumber](tidy-plumber.R)
```{r tidy-plumber}
```
